          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            If you've ever lived in Dubai, then you know one of two things:
            Dubai is a melting pot of different cultures and nationalities, a
            truly cosmopolitan city, but you also know that Dubai can also be a
            very lonely city.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project seeks to address the detached nature of Dubai's
            community by creating a stage where inhabitants within a
            micro-community are encouraged to interact with one another, and
            foster a sense of community.
          </p>
          <p>
            You see, experience design isn't simply about creating the right
            clicks and generating conversions. No, experience design can also be
            used to encourage the creation of a community.

            I've specifically chosen an empty land plot in Jumeirah that's set
            within an ideal distance from public transportation hubs. This
            specific site serves as a bridge between what is typically seen as
            an exclusive high-end area, and areas with people from wildly
            differing social strata and cultural backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might ask me at this point: What are you on about? What does
            this even have to do with user experience design?
          </p>
          <p>
            Bear with me for a second here: If you've ever gone to a bar in Dubai, then
            you'll very quickly learn that bartenders aren't encouraged to interact with
            customers, customers don't interact with people not within their own social
            group, and if you're on your own? You're out of luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had lived in the GCC for quite some time, and I can tell you first
            hand that I have never actually met my neighbours, nor have I ever
            interacted with them outside of a formal "hello". The lifestyle
            within the region doesn't really encourage it's the expatriate
            community to intermingle. This was always a pet peeve of mine, and I
            had to ask myself: Why don't neighbours interact with one another?
          </p>
          <h3 class="h5-size project-h">IBM's 5 Why's, and Design Thinking in action:</h3>
          <p>Neighbours in Dubai do not interact with one another.</p>
          <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
          <p>People live a busy life and are usually too exhausted to meet new people.</p>
          <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
          <p>People are overworked and traffic takes most any motivation to meet new people.</p>
          <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
          <p>Meeting new people requires a lot of concentrated and consistent effort.</p>
          <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
          <p>People need time before they can warm up and trust strangers.</p>

          <p>So there you have it, our problem statement is:</p>
          <p>Neighbours in Dubai do not interact with one another because they do not have time to generate trust due to their work/life balance.</p>
          <p>Now that we know what our problem is, we're going to go ahead and tackle it.</p>

            It'd be nice to be able to jump into creating an actual building
            in one go, but just like UX design, we need to wireframe, ideate,
            and validate our concepts.

            Typically we see yards placed either in the back of a housing
            unit, or in the front - these are aptly called backyards, and
            front yards. Now, what if we took that yard and placed it right in
            the middle of a unit and made sure that this courtyard has no
            physical separation between neighbouring units?

            The courtyard sets the social stage here. I liken it to how
            mothers would force their children to play with the other kids
            back in kindergarten. Sure you can choose not to interact with
            your neighbours, but it's very inconvenient. We've effectively
            created a user flow that encourages users to interact with their
            community, but we've also allowed them to go ahead and do their
            own thing. The best parallelism I can think about is that of
            MMORPGs or online multiplayer games. You can play an online game
            alone, but it's not fun, and it's typically much harder.

            Side Note: That tilt? It allows the study to retain space while
            also providing a legally compliant car parking spot, and enough to
            space to exit from the car comfortably. This goes back to a
            principle I hold very dearly: Form follows function.

            Brick and wood are not ever associated with the GCC region - But I reckon the
            breathability of these materials make them work far better than concrete ever
            can. Wood and brick suck in humidity and don't hold heat as much as concrete
            does. This is the equivalent of material design but in the physical world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I might also be low-key sadistic since I went through the
            painstaking effort of drawing every single brick instead of
            using a hatch. Wouldn't want to use a brick that's not measured
            at exactly 150mm x 300mm now, would we?

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Looking back at this project, I'll admit that it might have been a tad
              bit totalitarian but it was an interesting project that clearly shows
              how experience designers can work exactly like architects to encourage
              the desired outcome for their end-users. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not enough to create a project that works on a technical level,
              we need to make sure that what we've created will leave a positive
              impact on the users/inhabitants and the community surrounding the
              project.
