          <h2>Hello, I'm Moe.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a Strategic UX/CX Consultant based in the vibrant city of Dubai,
            United Arab Emirates. My journey, transitioning from architecture to
            UX design, has been fueled by a passion for creating meaningful
            impacts on individuals, communities, and businesses. I'm here to
            help you craft data-driven, evidence-based solutions that empower
            elevate your business, and aligning user needs with business goals
            seamlessly.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-top-margin">My Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            Design is more than just aesthetics: Design is innovative
            problem-solving. It's about transforming complex and wicked problems
            into new opportunities through a multidisciplinary approach,
            applying design thinking, research,  and UX methodologies to create
            meaningful solutions to real problems.

          <h3 class="caption project-h">Now Reading</h3>
          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">Hooked: How To Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal</h4>
          <p>
            What I like about this book so far is how conscious the author is
            about the ethical implications of the Hook Methodology. It's an
            eye-opening book that doesn't shy away from applied behavioural
            psychology.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">The Lean Startup by Eric Ries</h4>
          <p>
            As a UX specialist, I had some reservations towards anything Lean. I
            am a fan of Lean "Start-up" when executed correctly, but that's
            easier said than done for many start-ups. I highly recommend this
            book if you want to learn how to optimise your team's workflow in an
            innovative environment.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">The Little Book Of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle</h4>
          <p>
            I never miss an opportunity to preach about financial literacy and
            investing. Many designers shy away from financial matters, but we
            owe it to ourselves to learn more about it. As individuals, it helps
            secure a brighter future. As professionals, it helps align research
            and design with business needs. Bogle's philosophy mirrors the
            modernist designers' mantra: "Less is more". There is no magic
            involved, just passive, diversified, low-cost mutual funds and
            compound interest. This book is a must-read if you want to get
            serious about investing.
