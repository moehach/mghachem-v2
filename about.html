          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I am an Experience Designer currently based in Dubai, United Arab
            Emirates. I'm here to help you create data-driven, evidence-based, and
            practical solutions to human problems that will empower your clients
            and your business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I initially studied Architecture at the American University of Sharjah, and
            shortly after graduating pivoted to UX. because I wanted to make a real impact
            on individuals, communities, and businesses. On my journey to becoming a UX
            Specialist I picked up many different certifications, qualifications, and books
            which I've listed in a section below.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm an avid learner and constantly invest in my skillset focusing on both depth
            and breadth. I can get my hands dirty with web and software development, create
            VR worlds from scratch, research financial regulatory frameworks, and preach
            about design, financial literacy, and business development strategies. My
            technical skillset and wide breadth of knowledge and interest allow me to align
            user needs with business needs and create actionable insights or designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that at its core:
          </p>
          <p>
            Design is innovative problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's what I do! Throw me into any field, and I'll use design thinking,
            research and UX methodologies to tackle and solve wicked problems and turn them
            into new opportunities.
          </p>

            work. I work closely with the product, customer success, and
            business teams to create a platform revamp that will democratize and
            revolutionize live production by leveraging automation and embedding
            sophisticated intelligence into the software.

          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">Hooked: How To Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal</h4>
          <p>
            What I like about this book so far is how conscious the author is
            about the ethical implications of the Hook Methodology. It's an
            eye-opening book that doesn't shy away from applied behavioural
            psychology.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">The Lean Startup by Eric Ries</h4>
          <p>
            As a UX specialist, I had some reservations towards anything Lean. I
            am a fan of Lean "Start-up" when executed correctly, but that's
            easier said than done for many start-ups. I highly recommend this
            book if you want to learn how to optimise your team's workflow in an
            innovative environment.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">The Little Book Of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle</h4>
          <p>
            I never miss an opportunity to preach about financial literacy and
            investing. Many designers shy away from financial matters, but we
            owe it to ourselves to learn more about it. As individuals, it helps
            secure a brighter future. As professionals, it helps align research
            and design with business needs. Bogle's philosophy mirrors the
            modernist designers' mantra: "Less is more". There is no magic
            involved, just passive, diversified, low-cost mutual funds and
            compound interest. This book is a must-read if you want to get
            serious about investing.
