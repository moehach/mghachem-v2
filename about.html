          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I am Moe Hachem, a Customer and User Experience Research and Design Consultant
            based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. My mission is to create data-driven,
            evidence-based, and practical solutions to human problems that will empower your
            clients and your business.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating with a degree in Architecture from the American
            University of Sharjah, I transitioned to UX design because I wanted
            to make a real impact on individuals, communities, and businesses.
            Throughout my journey, I obtained various certifications and
            qualifications, and read countless books, all of which have equipped
            me with a multi-disciplinary skillset to create impactful solutions
            for my clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that at its core:
          </p>
          <p>
            Design is innovative problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            My wide breadth of knowledge and interests allows me to apply design
            thinking, research, and UX methodologies to tackle wicked problems
            and transform them into new opportunities.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">Hooked: How To Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal</h4>
          <p>
            What I like about this book so far is how conscious the author is
            about the ethical implications of the Hook Methodology. It's an
            eye-opening book that doesn't shy away from applied behavioural
            psychology.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">The Lean Startup by Eric Ries</h4>
          <p>
            As a UX specialist, I had some reservations towards anything Lean. I
            am a fan of Lean "Start-up" when executed correctly, but that's
            easier said than done for many start-ups. I highly recommend this
            book if you want to learn how to optimise your team's workflow in an
            innovative environment.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title h6-size">The Little Book Of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle</h4>
          <p>
            I never miss an opportunity to preach about financial literacy and
            investing. Many designers shy away from financial matters, but we
            owe it to ourselves to learn more about it. As individuals, it helps
            secure a brighter future. As professionals, it helps align research
            and design with business needs. Bogle's philosophy mirrors the
            modernist designers' mantra: "Less is more". There is no magic
            involved, just passive, diversified, low-cost mutual funds and
            compound interest. This book is a must-read if you want to get
            serious about investing.
