          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            Thawra, or revolution. Design is an important part of voicing civil
            dissent towards the state a country is in. As a strong believer of
            creating a socially responsible and socially responsive design, I
            saw it as my duty to contribute to the overwhelming voice of dissent
            sparking across my country, Lebanon.
          </p>

          <p>
            While opinions might vary, and while I understand that this is going
            to be a bit polarizing, I will state that I strongly believe that
            design should never take place in a vacuum. Design has a powerful
            ability to influence, inform, and when used maliciously misinform
            people. As a designer, I strongly believe that design should be a
            tool used for social empowerment and that designers should never shy
            away from being political when the end goal is to create a better
            world for all humans of all races, creeds, beliefs, and
            orientations.
          </P>

          <p>
            These are designs created for several social media accounts across
            Twitter and Instagram as a part of the process of voicing dissent
            towards following the outbreak of popular protests as of 17 October
            2019.

      <!--State of Affairs-->
      <div class="row project-margin-top">
        <div class="col-12">
          <h3 class="project-h">The State of Affairs</h3>
          <p>
            This first series takes on popular phrases heard throughout the
            initial phases of the protests between the 17th and 22nd of October.
            The issues highlighted the designs and illustrations try to go past
            the obvious phrase and points at different issues facing Lebanon.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first design takes on the phrase "It's time to abort you". In
            Arabic, the actual meaning of this phrase signifies "it's time you
            make you fall". Using the play on word between the double meaning of
            the word Nsa’etkon, the design points at the fact that women across
            Lebanon are not given their complete rights over their own bodies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second design says "the dose finished", in this context, it’s a
            nod to a popular phrase during the protests "the morphine dose that
            kept us, the people, drugged no longer affects us". The design gives
            another nod towards a huge medical crisis occurring in Lebanon,
            where medical supplies are at risk of running out completely.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third design plays on two different meanings: "The revolution is
            the pulse of the nation" and "The nation yelled out 'revolution'".
            This is one of those phrases that really brings out the beauty of
            Arabic as a language where depending on how you pronounce or stress
            the words, you've created a whole new meaning to the body of the
            text.

          <h3 class="project-h">Oudak Ranan</h3>

          <p>
            This series takes on lyrics from a popular song by Fayrouz called
            "Oudak Ranan" ("Your Lute is Sonorous") as a basis for the text.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first design depicts the usages of a pot, in reference to the
            "cacerolazo" protests. The line here says "Bang, keep banging, wake
            everyone up".
          </p>

          <p>
            The second design uses a frying pan and ladle that depict the time
            (set at 8:00 pm) that protestors agreed to bang their pots to voice
            their dissent. The phrase here says "The night isn't made for sleep,
            the night is for staying up".
          </p>

          <p>
            The phrase here states "You're the musician, you're the one with
            good taste, make them fly" which can also be translated as "You're
            the accurate one, you're the one with good taste, swat them".

            This design came as a reaction to a live speech by the President
            of Lebanon, where he said: "if the protestors cannot find a good
            person to represent them within the (current) state (political
            structure), then they should emigrate". Many protestors took the
            statement as a personal attack since the vast majority of Lebanese
            live in the diaspora. While the Presidency redacted the statement
            and tried to correct it, the damage had already been done among
            the local populace.
          </p>

          <p>
            The numbers listed in the ticket hint at specific dates in the
            history of the current President's political career that was, to
            say the least - moments of failure.

            Many designers, and people alike, might say "Oh I don't like
            politics", but at the end of the day, politics is an integral part
            of our lives. Does everything need to be politicized? Of course not,
            but if you can help your fellow humans by highlighting issues that
            they're facing, then why not at least try to do so, especially if
            there are no constraints on your shoulders?
          </p>
          <p>
            As visual communicators, I believe that we have a responsibility to
            highlight social issues when we are able to do so. Design can be a
            powerful tool that can empower people who are facing injustice
            regardless of their ethnicity, creed, sexuality, or their stance
            towards tabbouleh.
