          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            Full disclosure: Darkguard is not a "serious" project. The project
            exists within the fictional DC Universe's Gotham City. If you're up
            for some fun, this is the place for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Darkguard was a fun project I worked on for over two days.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy working on projects based on fictional worlds because it
            allows me to experiment with different methodologies or thought
            processes with no consequence. It's a reminder that there is a lot of
            enjoyment and child-like exploration under the serious-looking face of
            UX.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without further ado, I present to you: Darkguard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Darkguard is an application that will help Bruce Wayne with some of
            his more peculiar nighttime activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This news might come as a shock to you, but Bruce Wayne is Batman.
          </p>
          <p>
            The billionaire playboy has kept this part of his life hidden from
            plain sight. Our goal is to create an app that will help him fight
            crime effectively by leveraging different technologies and databases
            to ensure he's always in the right place and at the right time.

          <p>
            After meeting with Bruce, he introduced us to Commissioner Gordon from
            the Gotham Police Department. Gordon has given us access to the
            GothamAPI.
          </p>
          <p>
            GothamAPI will give us access to all incoming/outgoing calls to police
            stations across Gotham. By leveraging this technology, we can analyze
            calls, their source, location, and the caller's identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bruce wants us to integrate GothamAPI with BatAI, an artificial
            intelligence system that can collect data via GothamAPI. BatAI can
            assess the severity of a crime and possible suspects. It will allow us
            to keep Bruce informed with the latest updates on a case.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was quick to arrive at an effective solution.

          <p>
            All-Star Superman is based in Metropolis and can reach speeds of
            186,000 miles per second. Gotham and Metropolis are only 180 miles
            apart and exist within the same universe.

            Last I checked, Batman and Superman were on good terms. If we

            far less than a second, give or take server response time.

            You might think this section is unnecessary, considering we already

          </p>
          <p>
            If we dig deeper, we will find that Bruce has three different personas. Each
            persona surfaces depending on the circumstances, each serving a specific
            purpose. To help Bruce (or Batman), we need to understand the different masks he
            wears to find where we fit in the equation.

          <p>
            Public Bruce is the public face of Bruce Wayne (surprise!). He is an
            outlandish billionaire playboy that can charm the socks off of you.
            This persona is the public face of Wayne Enterprises, with the
            spotlight constantly shining on him, giving him nary a moment to
            cover any slip-ups or mishaps.

          <p>
            Private Bruce is more reserved than Public Bruce. He does not want
            the spotlight on him and would prefer to be left alone with his
            thoughts as he ponders over how he can make the world a better
            place. If you watch his interactions with Alfred, you begin to see a
            much more intimate and approachable person with a lot of weight on
            his shoulders.

          <p>
            Batman encompasses both the worst and best aspects of the Bruces. He follows a
            stringent moral code when it comes to justice. Batman wants to instil fear in
            the heart of the corrupt individuals living in Gotham. The differences between
            the Bruces and Batman aren't as vast as you might think they are. Batman is
            charitable (except his charity tends to leave people with a fat lip), caring,
            and just like the other Bruces: Driven by vengeance.

          <p>
            I'll be skimming through this section since it's not the focus of
            this project. Long story short, UI wasn't the focus of this project,
            but rather the underlying systems and flows and how they interact.
          </p>
          <p>
            I duplicated and repurposed a design system I had previously created
            to save time. I then adjusted the colours, typography choices, and
            icons used to conform with the art direction I had in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result? A fully fleshed-out library that has been customized
            according to the "Batman brand" while remaining accessible and in
            line with WCAG2.0's AAA rating for colour contrast ratios.

            Batman can view the latest updates and incidents as they come in
            from GothamAPI. BatAI parses the information to assign
            priority/severity levels to incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Low-priority incidents are not listed in the dashboard as they're
            typically cases that do not require Batman's attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            BatAI generates updates on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing cases
            Batman is actively tracking. The registration process gives users
            two different flows. Users can either register through OTP or via
            social media.

            The situation report (SitRep) gives Batman an overview of an

            With just a click of a button, Batman can deploy one of his vehicles
            to his location or get the engine started if he needs to make a fast
            getaway. He'll also be able to check his vehicle's system status to
            ensure it won't fail him. Nothing is as anti-climatic as giving up a

            introducing a private/public mode that would allow Bruce to mask the

          <p>
            I didn't think the mobile application would be enough. I wanted to
            add multiple touchpoints to help Bruce on different fronts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first front is tactical preparation. We've covered this front
            with the mobile application by arming Bruce with insights about
            situations so that he is not going in blind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second front is operations. I wanted to introduce non-intrusive
            and primarily passive devices that we can integrate with our
            application. These could be wearables like a smartwatch or other
            devices that do not emit too much light since Batman operates in the
            shadows.

          <h4 class="h6-size">Smart Lens</h4>
          <p>
            If you thought I was crazy earlier because I took this entire project
            seriously - You'd best skip this section.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was toying around with the idea of leveraging Smart Lens. WayneTech
            is a few years ahead of us in the technology department, so it's not
            too farfetched to think they'd have fully developed it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fun fact:  Mojo Vision is a real-world company that is working on
            Smart Lens.
          </p>

          <p>
            What if this technology could give Batman an edge if we embrace the
            more radical ideas it can enable? We might be able to give Batman an
            actual HUD view to monitor his health. We can link the Smart Lens to
            our system to help Batman identify suspects or victims. Batman could
            also have motion detection, low-light vision, and other visual
            augmentation tools that enhance Batman's natural abilities.
          </p>

          <h4 class="h6-size">Distress Signals</h4>
          <p>
            This idea is a bit more grounded in reality than the Smart Lens. We
            could use wearables to detect Batman's vitals. It's not hard to
            believe that there is a wearable that can detect heartbeats, blood
            pressure, and other factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            This device can then be hooked up to the app and send distress signals to
            trusted contacts the second it detects Batman is in grave danger.

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            User experience has real-world implications and real business
            implications. There's a lot at stake in UX: The business' and the
            users' time, money, and wellbeing. The high stakes might make it too
            easy to put on a serious face when goals, deadlines, KPIs, and OKRs
            keep taunting us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seriousness of designing experiences causes many UX designers to
            end up with an Atlas Complex as they attempt to (unnecessarily)
            carry the weight of the world on their shoulders.
          </p>
          <p>
            As UX specialists, we are privileged. We can explore, have fun,
            create, break, take apart, glue, and prod things until we've created
            something special.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have to make time and space for our imagination to run wild.
            Designing for unrealistic situations allows us to create a safe
            space for our imagination simply because the concept of failure need
            not exist in that space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like our muscles, if we neglect to train our imagination, we'll
            find it gasping for air when we need it to innovate on a real-world
            product.
