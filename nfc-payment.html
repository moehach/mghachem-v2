          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            This is a case study that looks at an existing NFC payment platform
            within Lebanon, specifically the Byblos Pay app, and improving it's
            UX/UI, and giving it a whole new look and feel. ByblosPay is a
            mobile payment application launched by Byblos Bank. The app gives
            customers the ability to conduct purchases through contactless
            payments from their phones based on Host Card Emulation (HCE), and
            NFC technology.

        <div class="col-12">
          <h3 class="h5-size project-h-3">First Launch</h3>
          <p>
            On the first launch, there's a noticeable issue with the
            application: When registering your first card, the application
            quickly asks for permission to use the camera, you cannot proceed
            otherwise. When you do give camera access to the application, the
            application lets you know that you can enter your card data
            manually, which is too little too late.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is currently a privacy concern. What if the user does not want
            to give the app permission to use their cameras? It is important to
            keep in mind that the average Lebanese has a general distrust or
            aversion towards the use of debit/credit cards, let alone using a
            mobile application to conduct their card payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I propose that to establish trust between the application and the
            user, the user flow ought to change. Instead of opening the camera
            by default, allow for the user to land on the manual data entry page
            first, and then give the user the option to use the camera for
            automated data entry.

          <h3 class="h5-size project-h-3">Payment User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            As is true with everything Lebanese - The app does a great job in
            conducting payment. It's so smooth you don't realise you've paid
            until it's too late, and you've no idea how much you've paid until
            you've paid it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally in UI/UX, it's always great to have everything go smoothly
            - but that doesn't apply when money is on the line. The average user
            in Lebanon already distrusts debit/credit cards (or at least does
            not properly understand how to use them), and making this payment
            process so smooth to the point that the user doesn't figure out how
            much is being made until after the transaction is made makes things
            much worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            How much are you paying the merchant? This should be confirmed on
            the screen itself. This is an opportunity to establish more trust
            with users.

          <p>
            The process of adding a new card, and managing your cards is where
            the application begins to break down. Two issues need to be
            addressed here:
          </p>
          <p>
            How is the user supposed to guess he or she needs to open the
            hamburger menu and find the "Add a New Card" button in the "Manage
            Cards" section? The other issue is the fact that the "Add a New
            Card" button is tucked at the bottom of the "Manage Cards" page in
            an in-ubiquitous manner.

          <h3>Analysing Heuristics</h3>
          <h4 class="h5-size project-h-3">Positives</h4>
          <p>
            What does the application do right?
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Shallow navigation allows the application to be quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The application makes use of the camera to eliminate manual data entry.</li>
            <li>Biometric/fingerprints can be used for an added layer of security.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5>Pain Points</h5>
          <p>
            Where does the application go wrong, and where could it improve?
            Please note that due to the application's security restrictions,
            screengrabs can't be provided, so I will attempt to illustrate the
            issues through text.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When an application includes sensitive data entry (such as card
              data), the UX probably should add 'friction' to the user flow.
              This friction would allow users to feel that they are in control
              of the entire process. Smooth flows are great, but sometimes you
              do need some road bumps to slow down the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              An intermediary page should be added between Adding a Card on the
              first launch and requesting camera permissions. It makes little
              sense that one can enter their information manually but still be
              required to give the application their camera permissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              An animation or image needs to be added for users to understand
              how to use the camera, and what to scan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manual record entry has a design issue. The application doesn't
              allow for screen-grabs so this will have to be explained through
              text: There is an image explaining what information to enter, but
              it is a lot more dominant than the input field. Having tested the
              screen with 5 different users, it took the majority of them far
              too long to understand what was happening on the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's unclear if there are transaction history records available.
              This should be made clearer or made available to establish even
              more trust between users and the application.
            </li>
            <li>
              The payment menu is susceptible to accidentally hitting Pay when
              the user might still be unsure.
            </li>
            <li>
              The keypad used for numerical data entry is the default system
              keypad with a different skin. Customizing the keypad will allow
              the application to spread and change the coordinate points of the
              keypad dials. This prevents malicious software or trackers from
              listening in and being able to detect what the user's code numbers
              are.

          <h3>Navigation Design</h3>
          <h4 class="h5-size project-h-3">Tab Navigation</h4>
          <p>
            The current menu is a Hamburger Menu. Hamburger Menus are known for
            being terrible for navigation purposes from a UX perspective since
            they hide important content.

          <p>
            Judging how this is a very specialized app, I proposed that the
            navigation take place using tabs to allow for easy, quick navigation
            without leaving the user guessing "Can I do this?".
          </p>

          <p>
            FAQ, Tutorial, and About are best grouped into Help. The FAQ is too
            vague a term for most users, "Tutorial" and "FAQ" are forms of Help,
            and it's common practice for many applications to put "About" under
            Help. The following are the new proposed menu items:

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            This project was a design charade that taught me a lot more than I
            expected. Looking back, I believe the main lesson this project
            taught me is that a smooth user flow is not necessarily the best
            user flow. Of course, this all depends on the context, but in the
            context of an application that involves money, that extra layer of
            privacy and friction allows for a better, safer, and far more
            trustworthy user experience. A smooth experience is great, but you
            don't want it to be too smooth that your money is gone before you
            even know it.
