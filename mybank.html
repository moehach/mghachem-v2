          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            MyBank was a part of an ideation workshop that lasted three days. A
            banking client asked me to conceptualize and create an MVP for a
            fully digital banking solution. The project ultimately didn't launch
            due to internal considerations on the client's side, but it's a
            project I enjoyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll find that this project bridges UX and product management. I
            loved the blurred boundaries because they allowed me to take ownership
            of the entire product's (albeit short) lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project also itches my love for all things fintech, securities,
            crypto, and digital assets. Why FinTech? Long story short: I've been
            very interested in financial inclusion and its implications on
            people's lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The need for financial inclusion and open and transparent frameworks
            becomes painfully apparent when dealing with banks. Most of us
            probably never had any pleasant experience with a bank, let alone
            simply opening an account. I wanted to tackle that and change the
            entire process of setting up an account and managing your finances
            while adhering to international and local regulatory frameworks.

          <h2 class="project-h">Due Diligence</h2>
          <h3 class="project-h-3">Brief Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the brief, the bank wants to be fully digital, meaning
            there won't be any physical branch past a dedicated call centre.
            Anything a user needs to be should be accessible through the
            application itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following are assumptions we've made about the bank and how it
            will operate:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The bank is fully digital and will have no physical presence.</li>
            <li>Anyone can open a digital account with MyBank, as long as they provide the required documentation.</li>
            <li>MyBank will strictly conform to KYC (Know Your Customer) and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) requirements.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!--Call Superman-->

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <h3 class="project-h">The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            There are strict international and local regulatory frameworks
            governing banking institutions. These frameworks are in place to
            monitor and limit any criminal or illicit financial activities such
            as money laundering. As a result, banks have to do their due
            diligence to ensure the integrity of their customers lest the banks
            face sanctions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process of providing these documents can be tedious in the real
            world. You, as a client, have to go to the bank with the required
            documents, typically an ID, proof of address, and proof of income.
            You then have to sit there awkwardly while your account manager
            tries to verify your identity and documents while you sit there
            smiling awkwardly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any time a client tries to open an account, we must ensure that the
            process, although fully digital, is also fully compliant with
            regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            One advantage digital banks offer is the elimination of human bias
            and prejudice. I'll explain why and how that's the case in the
            "Meeting KYC Requirements" section.

            I can't share the specific research, but I can share the following

          <P>
            A positioning statement is an expression of how a product or service
            differentiates itself and fulfils a specific user need in a way
            competitors do not. It's the hypothesis we are basing this design
            and product conception exercise on that we can later prove or
            disprove through research.
          </p>
          <P>
            For MyBank, my positioning statement is as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            For [the millennials] who [are looking to open a bank account to
            manage their finances and meet their banking needs], [MyBank] is a
            [Redacted] that [allows you to create a bank account remotely and
            manage your finances, portfolio, and monitor your spending habits].
            Unlike our [Competitor Name redacted], our product [allows you to
            open a free account from anywhere in the world].

          <p>
            The most crucial part of a digital banking app isn't the app
            features as much as it's the sign-up flow that's typically the
            barrier to entry. If the sign-up flow isn't easy to follow, we will
            be churning and losing users left and right.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also need the flow to be light-hearted while ensuring users
            provide the necessary information a bank needs to meet KYC
            requirements.

        <h3 class="project-h">Meeting KYC Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          To make KYC compliance smoother, I suggest using a machine learning
          algorithm to teach the computer how to verify and check data rather than
          depend on the human eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the algorithm flags an image as false, faulty, or otherwise
          unacceptable, the system will prompt users to re-submit their
          documents or provide additional information. If the user fails to pass
          the check a second time, a human is alerted for manual verification to
          ensure everything is in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to facial recognition algorithms, computers can
          outperform humans right now when it comes to accuracy. Leveraging this
          technology will allow us to create a banking app available 24/7 for
          account openings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bonus is that with careful programming, we can discount human bias
          and prejudice by leveraging machine learning and AI to take care of that
          task. It might sound like an odd thing to worry about, but those from
          non-US/EU countries can attest to how human prejudice (in all its forms)
          determines how smooth or pleasant the account opening process can be.

            My understanding of rules and regulations suggests we can give
            customers temporary approval while pending identity verification. We
            could allow users limited access to the app to explore it. Users can
            also deposit no more than $1,000 to their account, with strict
            limitations on money transfers until their account is fully
            activated.

            Admittedly I did this project long before I improved my levels of
            financial literacy and became a Boglehead. In retrospect, I would
            have wanted to introduce the option to invest in bonds and
            exchange-traded funds  (ETFs) rather than individual stocks. I would
            have also proposed an integration with a low-cost robo-adviser to
            help users get started with an easy-to-set-up and low-maintenance
            portfolio while educating them about securities. It's important to
            emphasize that this intervention is not to introduce securities
            trading but rather an investment tool - and there's a BIG difference
            between trading and investing.

            Back on track - Users can also make or schedule recurring payments

            directly to an IBAN.

            You'll notice that these wireframes specifically are a bit more

            This screen will only appear on the launch.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to emphasize that the onboarding screen must contain
            well-written copywriting to instil a sense of trust and security in
            prospective users.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll avoid using usage instructions since, according to many UX
            research centres (NNGroup primarily), onboarding instructions
            counterintuitively make interfaces appear harder to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why do instructional onboarding screens make interfaces appear hard?
          </p>
          <p>
            On a psychological level: If something needs instructions, it must
            be hard. Users might end up second-guessing themselves even when the
            action they need to take is simple.

            When a signed-in user launches the app, the system will require

            Users can access their account analytics from their account
            overview. Users can switch between different accounts within this
            screen by tapping on the balance. If users aren't too happy with
            their analytics and want to see their financial health improving,
            they can set a budget to help them take control of their spending
            habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            A possible feature for budgeting could be offering different methods
            to control it by introducing hard limits. This option could allow
            users to disable transactions temporarily if they go over their
            budget.

            In retrospect, I think we can take advantage of push notifications.
            We can send carefully worded notifications to help keep users
            accountable and shepherd them into staying on budget. Copywriting
            and notification frequency are crucial here. We can't send too many
            notifications to avoid overwhelming the user. We also can't be
            stand-offish because money and spending habits are sensitive matters
            (when was the last time you had a positive reaction when someone
            told you were being frivolous?).

            If you've seen some of my previous projects, you'll find that I'm
            fond of the swipe-to-pay method over simply pressing a button to
            confirm payment. The reasoning is that we mimic the act of swiping a
            card. It's also harder to accidentally swipe-confirm than to press a
            button.

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Looking back at this workshop, I'm happy with the result. I created
            a product concept and an MVP within a few days and was very
            efficient with how I used my time during this workshop.
          </p>
          <p>
            In retrospect, when I look at what I know now about financial
            literacy and the bit of freedom that comes with it, I'd have wanted
            to introduce interventions focused on investing capital, growing
            wealth, and teaching good financial habits. I would have cut out
            more features to focus on one goal: Building healthy habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the project requirements was to generate a high-fidelity
            prototype. In practice:
          </p>
          <p>
            I wouldn't want to design and develop a banking app in three days
            and create high-fidelity prototypes. It's doable, but it's not UX.
            Three days is not enough time to conduct thorough qualitative and
            quantitative research, create an affinity map, extract overarching
            themes, create a hypothesis, and validate findings against real
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I categorize this project as a bit of exercise to keep myself able
            to act under pressure, but at the same time, I'm all too aware that
            for many UX specialists out there, this is their reality and not a
            design exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            A valuable lesson that this project has taught me is the importance
            of understanding the framework and ecosystem your product will
            inhabit. I'm sure there were times when something in an app was
            unnecessarily hard to execute. You might have thought UX and UI
            designers should have done better. You might be right to think that,
            but it could also be a result of regulatory frameworks tying them up
            and forcing them to do things the inefficient way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding where your product will live can help you navigate
            hurdles and innovate as you work within existing constraints. Many
            teams complain about rules and regulations, but I believe you can
            only find practical and actionable opportunities for innovation
            within those constraints.
