              A UX Unicorn is a UX generalist, or someone who can take care of
              all aspects of the UX and visual design process, and is also good
              at coding.

          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            This project was created as part of the <!--googleoff:
            all-->Ecomz<!--googleon: index--> team, an eCommerce platform based
            in the MENA region. The project goal was to create a new face for
            the company in preparation for a product overhaul.
          </p>
          <p>
            The road to completion was troublesome and filled with awry moments,
            but perseverance and advocating for customer-centric design
            eventually won this battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sounds dramatic? Probably. I will say that this project was valuable
            to me. I learnt about who I am as a UX designer, art director, team
            lead, and frontend developer. The project helped show me just how
            much weight I can carry for an entire company to help them reach
            their goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I earned the title "UX Unicorn" after this project.

          <p>
            I'll spare you the details, but it's good to know that the company
            canned the project at one point. The project initially failed for
            reasons beyond my control. After the company shelved it, life
            continued as usual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the bombs dropped.
          </p>
          <p>
            We needed to deliver a complete website within two weeks, and we had
            no developers available to execute the designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was to take on the role of an entire agency.

            The company that initially created the re-brand of the company
            failed to supply a brand guideline. To fix that gap, I presented a
            series of colour swatches that fit the company's personality. The
            goal behind going through this effort wasn't just to say I
            supplemented the branding process. I wanted to take the brandmark
            and extend it into the software platform itself for future revamps.
            I wanted to boost brand recognition: I wanted you to know that our
            brand and platform are the same.

          <p>
            The initial site plan valued quantity, over quality. There were too
            many pages, and the written content was a bit lacklustre. I wanted
            to avoid creating a digital ghost town, so the first thing I did was
            simplify the structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step was to determine which of these pages I considered
            out-of-scope due to the time/resource limitations we were facing. The
            page titles that I greyed out are considered out-of-scope for this
            project.

            The plan was to keep the site architecture as simple as possible. The previous
            strategy was to go deep and throw out as many pages as possible for SEO
            purposes. My approach was the opposite: Place only the pages you need but make
            sure the content provided offered real tangible value to the users. There was no
            need for ghost pages that no one will ever visit. The goal is to provide quality
            and useful content.

      <!-- Design Principles-->

        <div class="col-12">
          <h3 class="project-h">Design Principles</h3>
          <p>
            I set clear rules for the design of the website that would guide
            it's development. The rules were as follows:
          </p>
          <ul class="project-ul-dashed">
            <li>The website must be inclusive and accessible.</li>
            <li>The website must be WCAG compliant.</li>
            <li>The website must be user friendly and easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>The fonts must use REM units with a base font set at 18px (1.125rem)</li>
            <li>All dimensions must use EM units.</li>
            <li>The design must be responsive.</li>
            <li>The website must load in under a second.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My distinguishing factor perhaps appears here: I lay out my designs
            and present them the same way I would architectural drawings.  I
            make sure every construction detail is known and clear. I leave no
            room for guess work. User experience is Architecture, but it uses a
            different format than a building for it's final product.

          <!--Buttons-->
          <h4 class="h5-size project-h-3">Call-to-Action Buttons</h4>
          <p>
            The call to action button looks simple enough, but the process was
            anything but simple. I needed the CTA button to fit WCAG2.0
            requirements, work with the brand, the website design, and the SAAS
            platform itself. It's funny, but the CTA button was the element that
            dictated how the brandmark would turn out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why go through so much effort for a button?
          </p>
          <p>
            A button might be the most crucial element on a website. Users press
            a button for a product they want to X, and you get Y out of it.
            Buttons are points of interaction and transactions. It's worth going
            through the effort to unify your UX, UI and Brand experience. Make
            your users tap on your brand's button, and not just a generic one.
          </p>
          <p>
            So tell me, what's in a button?
          </p>

            The main CTA button grabs attention, but it's ill-suited for the
            navigation bar. It's visually heavy, and if it's following you
            around the screen, it becomes intrusive. I needed to set these rules
            to keep the brand clean, but also to avoid abuse from future
            designers or web developers.

            I admit I wanted to be a lot more experimental with the navigation

            traditional burger menu - Fair enough. It's not the best location

            I like to call this the "duck, duck, goose" effect, or "not a designer,
            not a designer, a designer". Trust your designers to deliver what's
            best for you, and put faith in their design methodologies. Most
            design-monstrosities I've seen have come as a direct result of a
            non-designer intervention and the HiPPO effect.
          </p>

          <p>
            The new homepage design gets rid of all the excesses the previous
            designs had. There's a misunderstanding with non-designers that
            assumes "whitespace" is wrong. Negative space creates good design,
            and it's the differentiating factors that determine how legible or
            readable your compositions are. Colours are limited and only used
            when I needed them to help propagate/encourage a user down the page.

            The most important part of the project was to make sure the website
            also supported Arabic content. User experience and localization go
            hand-in-hand. Localization cannot be an afterthought in the UX
            process. If this is something you wanted to do - Then I highly
            recommend you look into WeGlot. I wouldn't recommend it if you plan
            to create a blog, but for a regular website? It's very versatile.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, it's not as simple as just adding Arabic content. I had
            to recreate my CSS to allow for language-responsive design without

            Of course, it's not as simple as just adding Arabic content. I had

            As long as you've made sure you haven't hard-coded left-aligned text
            into other CSS properties, this will typically do the trick
            instantly. Alternatively, using the "display: flex;" CSS property
            tends to take care of this for you too!

          <h3 class="project-h">Solution Pages</h3>
          <p>
            The solution page is a template-style page in which ~8 other related
            pages use the same design.  You get the title, CTA, and feature
            lists with icons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial design wanted to create custom illustrations for every single
            feature, but it wasn't feasible. Using icons, however, would allow the graphic
            designer involved to work more efficiently. The truth is, adding an illustration
            to every single one of our features was unnecessary and a waste of resource.
            This way, I managed to cut down the graphic work execution time to as little as
            a week, rather than the three months we would have needed if we illustrated
            everything.

            The 404 page is one of those pages that don't get the love they

          <p>
            Admittedly I am not a fan of the pricing page due to the format
            imposed. It's hard to get a pricing table such as this to be
            accessible, so I had drawn up a proposal to fix this page in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The page comes with two different version: a mobile-friendly table,
            and a desktop table. More specifically, I set a breakpoint at 767px
            where a different HTML/CSS structure is loaded that was better
            suited for mobile view.

        <div class="col-12">
          <h3 class="project-h">Contact Page</h3>
          <p>
            I kept the contact form minimal to reduce friction. I always like to
            preach the following fundamental rules when it comes to form design:
          </p>
          <ul class="project-ul">
            <li>Keep it short and very simple.</li>
            <li>Can two fields be merged into one? Then go ahead and do it.</li>
            <li>Only ask for what's necessary to communicate with your clients.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What do you need to establish rapport with a curious client? You
            certainly don't need the name of the company they work with or their
            address, or whether or not they like pecan pie. You only need their
            full name, their email address, and their message. I've effectively
            reduced the number of fields from 6 down to 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a tip: If the form is the primary element in the page, then
            autofocus that first field. Don't forget to point out which fields
            are required, and which aren't.
          </p>

      <!-- Theme Store Page -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <h3 class="project-h">Theme Store</h3>
          <p>
            The Theme Store page was a tough cookie!
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to set up a database of available fields, apply the
            appropriate tags and features to them, feed them into a DIV wrapper,
            then create a filtering system.
          </p>

          <p>
            The theme store page looks simple enough, but there's a lot of magic
            going on under the hood. I created the themes database to allow
            anyone with access permission to log in to our database and add or
            edit a theme without needing any code intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take a look at how I did this:
          </p>

          <p>
            Each theme has a dedicated page. Each page contains an image of it's
            mobile and desktop views. The pages must also showcase the unique
            features unique to each theme.
          </p>

          <p>
            So we've figured out we had the following databases:
          </p>

          <ul class="project-ul">
            <li>Master Theme CMS page</li>
            <li>Price category</li>
            <li>Target industry</li>
            <li>Navigation style</li>
            <li>Layout</li>
            <li>Product image layout</li>
            <li>Premium features</li>
            <li>Activated features</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Each of these fields is input dynamically into each theme page.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Theme Data Structure -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>
            We'll take an in-depth look at how the databases interact with one
            another. The Theme has data fields embedded in it, which I represented
            in dashed lines. These fields determine theme-specific qualities such
            as its name, description, and screenshots.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Theme also pulls assigned information from external databases that
            contain fields that are present across different themes.
          </p>
          <p>
            By implementing the theme database structure this way, we manage to create a
            dynamic Theme object that can change as needed without negatively affecting
            other themes.
          </p>

            The blog is set up similarly as the Themes, but it didn't need the
            complexity that the theme pages required.
          </p>
          <p>
            I migrated the old blog to the new website and optimised the old
            images for the web. I made sure that the Marketing team was aware of
            the size requirements and image optimisation process to ensure that
            the uploaded images did not affect load times.

            I'm quite happy with the blog post page. The database we went through above is
            responsible for generating the blog posts. All the marketing team has to do to
            is paste the articles they've prepared using Google Docs straight into the
            post's Rich Text Field editor, assign authors/tags/categories, and that's all
            there is to it!

            I've hooked up the blog post page with three different functionalities:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sticky social share icons that follow the user as they scroll down the page while remaining unintrusive.</li>
            <li>I added a comment section to encourage community discussion.</li>
            <li>I placed code to dynamically generate a social share image whenever a user shares a post.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The comment section was a Facebook plugin and was easy to set up.
          </p>
          <p>
            The social share icons were fairly straight forward to set up - You
            only need to add the appropriate link extension to share on the
            target platform. To make it dynamic, I set up the share button's
            HTML anchor link in the following manner:
          </p>
          <pre class="code">
            href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.DOMAINNAME.com/blog/{{slug}}"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            aria-label="Share on Facebook"
          </pre>
          <p>
            This way, I ensured that all the marketing team had to worry about
            was creating captivating and meaningful content.

          <p>
            The request-a-demo page proved the hardest to set up. Initially,
            marketing asked for much more fields, but they agreed to reduce the
            number present to make the form appear less daunting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating the form was simple enough, but hooking up the form to the
            Hubspot database when using a custom form format? That was a
            challenge. The "forms" also needed phone number validation to ensure
            submissions came from serious candidates. We also needed a way to
            track original and referral sources while to overcome a limitation
            with our Hubspot integration.

      <!-- Code details-->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>
            Lets take a look at the code details of the form.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were two requirements for the form: We needed to save the
            Arabic submissions in a separate database than the English ones.
            The initial solution involved using CSS to show/hide different
            forms depending on the active website language. This solution
            wasn't very feasible because we eventually had four 'forms' on
            the page: Two for mobile, and two for desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's the structure of a HubSpot form? To send a call to
            Hubspot to capture a form, you needed to use a specific form key
            to capture and save it in the correct location.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in pseudo-code:
          </p>
          <p>
            If the document language is Arabic, find the form element and
            change the form key to the Arabic key, else keep it the English
            form.
          </p>

          <pre class="code">

            function init() {
              //Get HTML Language
              var docLang = document.documentElement.lang;
              //Reference Form
              var myForm = document.getElementById('requestForm');
              // Set Arabic Form Key
              var formAR = "hubspot-key-goes-here";
              //If page is arabic change key
              if (docLang == "ar") {
                myForm.setAttribute('data-vimkit-success', formAR);
              }
            </pre>
            <p>
              The next step is to slot in the referral and the original source
              to ensure our integration worked as expected. One of the issues
              we faced was that our integration automatically classified
              submissions as "Direct Traffic". We had no visibility whether
              people were coming from our ad campaigns or organically. To
              overcome this shortcoming, we injected code that would place
              sources in a hidden input field inside the form.
            </p>
            <p>
              What does this have to do with user experience? Admittedly from
              a user's perspective, there isn't much that this adds to them.
              We made this move specifically to improve the employee
              experience of our marketing and sales team. Our team had more
              insight and information as to which playbook they should use
              when approaching prospective clients. Do I agree with this? On a
              personal level, no, but on a business level? I understand why
              they needed this visibility, and it was visibility I was willing
              to grant them because it allowed the company to understand
              whether our Ad campaigns were reaching our audience or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Okay so let's look at the pseudo-code:
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we need to access local storage to get the "referrer" and
              "original" source and set them as properties of the page. Then
              we needed to take these sources and input them into two hidden
              form fields when the page loads.
            </p>
            <p>
              How does this look like in code?
            </p>
            <pre class="code">

              //Get referrer source
              var referrer = localStorage.getItem("referrer");
              if (!referrer) {
                localStorage.setItem("referrer", document.referrer);
              }
              //Get original source
              var original = localStorage.getItem("original");
              if (!original) {
                localStorage.setItem("original", window.location.href);
              }
              //Input to sources to fields fields
              //The hidden input fields have an ID associated with them so that the code knows where to input the data.
              document.getElementById("originalsource").value = original;
              document.getElementById("referralsource").value = referrer;
            </pre>
            <p>
              Okay! There's one last step: We needed to make sure our
              submissions were coming from serious leads. There's no foolproof
              way to get this done since there's always going to be a spambot
              that'll be programmed to fool the system. We have built-in
              detectors, but there's one additional layer I needed to add:
              General form and Phone number validation.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the Phone Number validation, I'll spare you the code, but
              it's good to know that we plugged the "Intl-Tel-Input" library.
              The plugin checks the user's number format against known
              international phone number formats.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the user enters an invalid phone format (too short, too long,
              or a wrong format for the chosen country), then the form will
              ask the user to fix the number.
            </p>
            <!--Validation Demo-->

            <p>
              Setting up to the plugin was easy. Making it play nice with the form validation? Not so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's look at the pseudo-code to understand how I made it work:
            </p>
            <p>
              If the user did not complete the form, then disable the submit
              button. Keep checking if the user filled all the required fields
              and provided a valid phone number. If everything checks out,
              enable the form submission button, and allow the user to submit
              the form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lets see at how it looked like in code:
            </p>
            <pre class="code">

              function validateButton() {
                var buttonDisabled =
                //If the name field is empty
                $('#name').val().trim() === ''
                // or the email field
                || $('#email').val().trim() === ''
                // or the phone number is not valid
                || iti.isValidNumber() !== true
                // or no dropdown option is selected for store, industry, or business description
                || $('#store')[0].selectedIndex === 0
                || $('#industry')[0].selectedIndex === 0
                || $('#hs_persona')[0].selectedIndex === 0;
                $('#form-submit').prop('disabled', buttonDisabled);
              }
            </pre>
            <p>
              That's it! Now we've got the form that's language-responsive, and self-validating.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!--Form Diagram-->
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-12">
            <p>
              Creating the landing page was the easy part. The hard part is making
              the form work with the company's lead scoring system. Let's take a
              look at how we capture form data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since there's no way to connect Hubspot to the website's backend, we
              needed to use an integration to allow us to relay the information to
              Hubspot.
            </p>
            <p>
              We first capture the referral/original sources automatically using
              our script, which I've represented in dashed lines. The next step is
              to validate the form. When all fields are filled and validated, the
              submit button activates.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a user clicks on the submit button, our integration captures
              the form data and relays it to Hubspot.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

            <p>
              There was a 1,333% increase in form submission rates over the past
              three months. That's one thousand, three hundred, and thirty-three
              per cent. Sales are overbooked with client meetings and have stopped
              visiting the product team ever since.

            <p>
              Below, you can find the lighthouse site performance report before
              the company required me to add script plugins for Marketing and
              Customer Support purposes. To help alleviate the damage those
              plugins inflicted, I made sure that they were loaded asynchronously,
              which allowed the website to still load in under second.

            <h3 class="project-h">Key Factors for Success</h3>
            <p>
              Teamwork is essential in creating successful projects. If a project
              has been, but the team did not have an assigned project manager, the
              project will probably fail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Communication is essential for the delivery of successful projects.
              More importantly, checking out your ego will be the determining
              factor that affects your project success. Ego results in project
              failure because, by default, ego does not allow for clear
              communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you've set up a project lead, and you've clearly outlined the
              project goals, then your team will be more likely to succeed.
              Every team member will know their role and will know what needs to
              get done. You also need to be proactive and foresee risks and
              failure modes. Planning a project is crucial, but failing to
              address possible risks could throw all your planning out the
              window.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project taught me the value of teamwork and clear
              communication. Through leveraging these two principles, I managed
              to complete a task that was out of my job scope, and deliver it
              ahead of time. Had I failed to communicate the risks, or what I
              needed to guarantee success, then I would never have managed to
              deliver the project on time.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              The original website took six months to implement then fail to
              launch, whereas it took me fourteen days to deliver the website
              from scratch. Of course, there's also the fact that conversion
              rates skyrocketed overnight, but I'm a lot happier with how I
              managed to prove myself (to myself).
            </p>
            <p>
              What I loved about this project was it truly encompassed my stance
              towards Total Design. As a UX designer, my job is to understand
              the "why of things". I used design thinking to teach myself how to
              apply code I've never been exposed to before, set up databases,
              and create multilingual websites. I outlined the problems,
              gathered the resources I needed, and devised the solutions to
              address them.
            </p>
            <p>
              While designers don't need to know how to code, they should
              understand how the pieces fit in together. This project allowed me
              to implement my design approach on all possible levels - Had I
              been asked to design the office space, I'd have gone ahead and
              done that to unify the brand experience at all levels.
